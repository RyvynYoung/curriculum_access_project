    "## Initial questions to answer\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?\n",
    "     - know this for data science cohorts\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    " 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over? \n",
    "     - know this for data science\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students? \n",
    "     - data inaccuracy casts doubt on effectiveness of looking at this metric\n",
    "     - Overall Population mean and percentiles (note: this is NOT filtered down to only during cohort in session time)\n",
    "            - Average Accesses per user_id (for full date range in dataset)\n",
    "            - mean: 659\n",
    "            - 25%: 133\n",
    "            - 50%: 728\n",
    "            - 75%: 1637\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses? Any odd user-agents?\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 5. At some point in the last year, ability for students and alumni to cross-access curriculum (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?\n",
    "     - there is evidence of Bayes and Curie students accessing Java-i and Java-ii lessons, no access in Darden\n",
    "     - know this for data science\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? \n",
    "     - note Darden has not graduated so Data Science refers only to Bayes and Curie\n",
    "     - for data science = SQL the Fundamentals\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 7. Which lessons are least accessed? \n",
    "     - know this for data science\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 8. Anything else I should be aware of? \n",
    "     - NOTE: accesses to home page only (\"/\") have been filtered out\n",
    "     - if average page viewed per user is under the 25th percentile inaccuracies in user_id assignment and dropped students should be investigated before determining that there are just some student who access the curriculum less overall\n",
    "    - there are user_id that are substaintially below the mean, but investigation into Darden showed this can be a result of duplicate ids being assigned halfway through class or students who drop from class"
