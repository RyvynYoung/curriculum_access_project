    "## Initial questions to answer\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?\n",
    "     - know this for data science cohorts\n",
    "     - for all = Javascript-i (75K), mysql and html-css both around 55K\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over? \n",
    "     - not for web dev, top 60 by cohort are the same 3-5 lessons, some cohorts may vary in order slightly, but lessons are consistent\n",
    "     - - regression is more popular for Bayes and Curie, but it was classification for Darden\n",
    "    - this is most likely because in Bayes and Curie the first big project was in regression but in Darden classification was moved ahead of regression and was the first big project\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - also Darden has not yet reached nlp so it does not rank as highly as in the other 2 cohorts\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students? \n",
    "     - data inaccuracy casts doubt on effectiveness of looking at this metric\n",
    "     - Overall Population mean and percentiles (note: this is NOT filtered down to only during cohort in session time)\n",
    "            - Average Accesses per user_id (for full date range in dataset)\n",
    "            - mean: 659\n",
    "            - 25%: 133\n",
    "            - 50%: 728\n",
    "            - 75%: 1637\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses? Any odd user-agents?\n",
    "     - unable to find oddities without reasonable explaination\n",
    "     - large usage past grad date for cohort 1 and 14 turned out to be Codeup IP addresses\n",
    "     - other IP with multiple users appear to be telecom companies masking user IP\n",
    "     - as expected most cohorts stop accessing after graduation except for a few users\n",
    "     - more recently graduated cohorts continue to access, particularly during job search and early placement\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 5. At some point in the last year, ability for students and alumni to cross-access curriculum (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?\n",
    "    - note there was access in Bayes to Java i and Java ii\n",
    "    - also in Curie java ii\n",
    "    - no access from Darden\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 2 users in Bayes, all access within cohort session\n",
    "    - first user = 14 observations from Sept and November\n",
    "    - 2nd user = 3 observations in Dec\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1 user in Curie, single access during cohort session\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - not sure if \"fundamentals\" is used in both curriculum but as of 11/1/2020 there is a user in Bash who is accessing data science curriculum with lessons in anomaly-detection, classification, clustering, distributed-ml, nlp, python, regression, storytelling, and timeseries\n",
    "\n",
    "    - most other accesses are in 2019 or early 2020, but this current access indicates access has not yet been turned off across the board\n",
    "  \n",
    " 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? \n",
    "     - note Darden has not graduated so Data Science refers only to Bayes and Curie\n",
    "     \n",
    "    - for data science most common lesson post graduation = SQL \n",
    "\n",
    "    - for all = Javascript-i (almost 20K), spring and html-css (both at 15K)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    " 7. Which lessons are least accessed? \n",
    "    - know this for data science\n",
    "    - long list for web dev, but look like pages from appendix or pages that have been replaced (typos) \n",
    "  \n",
    " 8. Anything else I should be aware of? \n",
    "     - NOTE: accesses to home page only (\"/\") have been filtered out\n",
    "     - if average page viewed per user is under the 25th percentile inaccuracies in user_id assignment and dropped students should be investigated before determining that there are just some student who access the curriculum less overall\n",
    "    - there are user_id that are substaintially below the mean, but investigation into Darden showed this can be a result of duplicate ids being assigned halfway through class or students who drop from class\n",
    "    - did not devel deeply into null cohort values"
